I'm a fourth year PhD student in [HCA Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Katie Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/). Before my PhD journey, I was an undergraduate at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), where I majored in Electrical Engineering.

My current research focuses on the intersection of robotics and machine learning. My lifelong goal is to bring research ideas in papers to technology in daily life.

Research interests:
- Robot Perception
- Sensor Fusion
- Safe Autonomy
- Motion Tracking
- Machine Learning
