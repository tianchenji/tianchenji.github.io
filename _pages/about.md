I'm a third year PhD student in [HCA Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Katie Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/). Before my PhD journey, I was an undergraduate at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), where I majored in Electrical Engineering.

My current research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and robotics. My lifelong goal is to bring research in papers to technology in daily life.
